Truffle provides much of the functionality possible of this app. Truffle facilitates testing, deployment, and development. Furthermore, it helps to 
provide a fully integrated test environment so that it does not need to be done manually. It is used in this project specifically to create a development 
enironment so that I can test the application functionality. It is also used to run the test cases.

#### Web3 Version:
v1.3.6

Web3 is a collection of javascript libraries that allow an application to interact with an ethereum network. It is being used extensively in this application to 
encapsulate much of the logic around the etherum blocchain. For example, it is used to convert wei to ethereum and back, it is used to encapsulate logic of big numbers, 
and also allows us to interact with Metamask.
